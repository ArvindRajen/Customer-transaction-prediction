# Facial Recognition
Facial recognition on dataset of 40 Faces and using different machine learning to see their performance.

There can be no two similar fingerprints in the World but there sure can be more than 10 familiar and similar faces out of the 7 billion people on Earth. 
So how does AI even begin to differentiate people when even people have trouble recognizing other people. This project shows what insights I got on AI when
it comes to recognizing people.
